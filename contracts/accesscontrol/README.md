# GET Protocol - getNFT Access Control
Open Zeppelins 'AccessControl" repository is used to manage these roles. By default we recognize 3 role types `RELAYER_ROLE`, `MINTER_ROLE` and `FACTORY_ROLE`. 
- `RELAYER_ROLE`: Relayer address(es) - operated by GET Protocol Engine. Likely a EOA account.
- `MINTER_ROLE`: Minter address(es) - operated by GET Protocol Engine. Likely a EOA account.
- `FACTORY_ROLE`: Address of getNFT factory contract - operated by GET Protocol Foundation. These are contract addresses (not an EOA).
